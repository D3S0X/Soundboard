# Introduction
I didn't find any good soundboard application for linux so I created one. It uses pulseaudio modules to achieve a universal interface. You can select every recording stream for the audio output. The GUI is written with Qt.

It is currently in alpha because I don't know if this works for everyone.

# Runtime Dependencies
Please refer to your distro instructions on how to install
- [pulseaudio](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio)
- [mpg123](https://www.mpg123.de/) (optional: for playing mp3 files)

# Compilation & Installation

## Arch Linux and derivatives
You can install my package with your AUR helper of choice which will automatically compile and install the master branch
```sh
yay -S soundux-git
```

## Other distros

### Dependencies
This list may be not accurate. Contact me if you find missing dependencies that I can update this list
- [qpm](https://github.com/Cutehacks/qpm)
- [qt5-base](https://github.com/qt/qtbase)
- [qt5-tools](https://github.com/qt/qt5)

### Install dependencies for Ubuntu and derivatives (Thanks to @Tibladar)
```sh
sudo apt install git golang-go qt5-default libqt5x11extras5-dev mpg123
go get qpm.io/qpm
```

### Build
Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/D3SOX/Soundux.git
cd Soundux
```
Install dependencies
```sh
# If you installed qpm via go
~/go/bin/qpm install
# Otherwise
qpm install
```
Create a build folder and start compilation
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ..
make
```
To start the program
```sh
./Soundux
```

### Install
Automated Installation is currently not available but will be available in the future. (You may look into my [arch package](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=soundux-git) and figure it out for your distro)
